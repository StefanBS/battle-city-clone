# Enemy Tank Types

## Basic Tank (Short Cannon Tank)

*   **Appearance:** Standard enemy tank, often gray.
*   **Speed:** Slow movement and slow bullets.
*   **Firepower:** Fires at the same speed as a player with no upgrades.
*   **Durability:** Destroyed with one shot.
*   **Behavior:** Poses little threat; easy to avoid and destroy. Common in early stages and serves as the game's basic enemy.

## Fast Tank (6 Tire Cart Tank)

*   **Appearance:** Slightly different design, sometimes with more wheels.
*   **Speed:** Fastest among enemy tanks.
*   **Firepower:** Fires slow bullets, similar to the Basic Tank.
*   **Durability:** Destroyed with one shot.
*   **Behavior:** Moves rapidly across the map, making it harder to hit and more likely to reach and threaten the player's base quickly. Should be prioritized if near the base.

## Power Tank (Long Cannon Tank)

*   **Appearance:** Features a longer cannon barrel.
*   **Speed:** Normal movement speed.
*   **Firepower:** Fires fast bullets, faster than other enemy tanks.
*   **Durability:** Destroyed with one shot.
*   **Behavior:** More dangerous due to rapid-fire shots that are harder to dodge. Can break through brick walls more quickly, especially notable in later stages.

## Armor Tank (Armored Tank)

*   **Appearance:** Initially green, turns gray as it takes damage.
*   **Speed:** Normal movement speed.
*   **Firepower:** Fires slow bullets.
*   **Durability:** Requires four shots to destroy.
*   **Behavior:** The toughest enemy, acting as a moving obstacle. Its slow speed makes it less of a direct threat, but its high durability can distract or block the player. Best attacked from the side or after collecting power-ups.
